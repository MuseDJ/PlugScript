MuseScript is a bookmarklet and (possible Chrome/Firefox extension) to improve the functionality of [plugdj](http://plug.dj).  Many exist currently but only few exist that are open source such as this one.  The most well known currently include PlugCubed, TastyPlug, Radiant Community Script, and ExtPlug.  Of which only 3 are open-source and one of which allows modding/plugin writing.

MuseScript plans to allow modular functionality, this allows others to create plugins and load them with the extended API offered by MuseScript.
